# Die Roller

## Usage

Very simple. Run the script giving an arbitrary number of `<n>d<s>` strings,
where `s` is the number of sides and `n` is the number of that type of die. The
dice will be reported individually with the highest value marked, and summed.
You can give a bonus too.The --agon flag will roll the dice in accordance with a
Contest in the [Agon](http://www.agon-rpg.com/) system. The bonus is used as the
Strife level, and the readout will give you a result for if you're playing as a
hero or strife player.
